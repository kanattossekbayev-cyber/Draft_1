Draft_1_Kanat : This draft replicates and extends a 2019 cost-effectiveness analysis of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) expansion in Ukraine, focusing on Kyiv. The replication confirmed the original findings: a major OAT scale-up in Kyiv is cost-effective, yet coverage would plateau around 20% due to limited demand from structural barriers. The proposed extension uses machine learning for an advanced sensitivity analysis. It aims to identify critical, non-linear parameter interactions that determine a strategy's success, providing a more comprehensive risk map for policymakers under deep uncertainty.
kyiv_replication_analysis.R : This R code successfully replicates a cost-effectiveness study on opioid agonist therapy in Kyiv, verifying key model parameters with 85.7% accuracy against the original research.
oat_capacity_functions.R : This R file contains the core functions for replicating the cost-effectiveness analysis model of opioid agonist therapy expansion in Ukraine. It includes routines for parameter processing, ODE system integration, and calculating key outcomes like costs, QALYs, and injection frequencies.
smpl_joint_kyiv50K.Rdata :  is an R workspace file containing a ~50,000-record sample dataset for Kyiv. It aggregates cleaned variables used in our replication analyses, including dates, facility identifiers, service volumes, capacity metrics, outcomes, and covariates.
